## 📝 Current Logo Setup

Your logo is currently in: `components/Logo.tsx`

To replace it:
1. Get/create your logo file (SVG preferred)
2. Save it to `/public/logo.svg` or `/public/logo.png`
3. Update `components/Logo.tsx` to use an `<Image>` component pointing to your file

Or if you get an SVG, you can paste it directly into the component.
